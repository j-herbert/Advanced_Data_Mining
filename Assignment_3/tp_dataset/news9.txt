A tiny component has the potential to revive a smart-home strategy that has trailed Amazon and Google.
The Lede
The HomePod mini speaker, launched last November, has a sensor that measures a room's temperature and humidity. The sensor, 1.5 by 1.5 millimeters in size, is embedded at the bottom of the device's plastic case and currently is not switched on.
Key Details
Apple has discussed internally the possibility of using the sensor to connect to other smart home devices such as thermostats and fans to adjust a room's temperature and humidity.
Apple is currently trailing in the smart-home market, but this dormant capability might allow it to catch up with its competitors, including Amazon's latest Echo speakers, which come with temperature sensors.
An Apple representative declined to say when the sensor might be enabled for consumers.
